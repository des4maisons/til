# Steamed stuff

For steamed stuff, include the steamer rack and put 1 to 1.5 cups water in the
bottom. All times below are for Manual (high) setting.

- green beans: 1 min; it's important to release steam immediately and remove
    beans to cool off.
- beets: 22-25mins (if the beets are large, err on cooking longer); not
    important if you release steam right away.
- frozen dumplings and buns: 4-7 mins; you can make multiple layers using
  pierced tin foil; probably not important if you release steam right away.

# Rice

All rice shuold be cooked at a ratio of 1-1 water to rice, plus 1/4c extra.
Time table is below, for Manual (high) setting. After rice is cooked, turn off
pressure cooker and let rest 10 mins before releasing pressure.

- white basmati rice: 4-8 mins
- brown basmati rice: 23 mins
- brown rice: 22-28 mins

# Lentils & Beans

Rinse lentils first. Cover lentils with water/liquid, and a little extra. It's
not important to release the pressure right away. If cooking unsoaked beans
(not lentils), don't fill pressure cooker to more than 1/2 because of
expansion. Cooking times are on Manual (high) setting.

- red lentils, split: 15-18 mins.

# TIL

This repo logs the tidbits I learn or think of that I want to recall easily.

## Layout

It's not super well organized! Here are the files and directories in order of
most frequently updated.

- [til.md](/til.md) -- mostly technical things I have learned. Specific command
    invocations that are easy to forget but that I hate googling for.
- [thoughts/](/thoughts) -- Ways to think about things, words of wisdom from
    others, etc. [random.md](/thoughts/random.md) is probably the most
    frequently updated.
- [notes/](/notes) -- Notes from conferences,
    training, research
- [recipes/](/recipes) -- Recipes I probably found [somewhere on the
    internet](vegrecipesofindia.com) that I reorganized into a format that I
    like.
- [TODO.md](/TODO.md) -- things I want to learn one day.

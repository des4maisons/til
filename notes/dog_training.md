- When I tell my dog "no", she will stop the bad thing momentarily, but she is
    not reinforced for doing so.
    - I can tell her "no" every time she comes near the kitchen, and she sort
        of gets it. Perhaps she reasons that she doesn't want to risk making me
        mad, and the kitchen's not that great anyway.
        - But since she'd rather be by the kitchen, I'm fighting against
            her instinct to teach her this.
        - Moreover, when I'm not there, there's no reason *not* to go to
            the kitchen.
    - I can tell her "no" every time she pulls.
        - But she is present in the moment, immersed in being outside. She
            probably doesn't have much room in her brain to reason about "no"
            vs "pull". She slows down, but soon speeds up again.
        - Moreover, each time she does this she is being reinforced for
            ignoring me.
    In the case of the pulling, I first need to break into her moment, become
    more than just a "no". In both cases, I need to provide a rewarding
    alternative to the undesirable behaviour.

- A behaviour is "reinforced" when it is "rewarded".  Whatever behaviour a dog
    was doing when it got rewarded is reinforced.
    - It has always been my dog's instinct to pull. Now, that pulling has been
        reinforced by a thousand walks during which she has pulled, and been
        rewarded by making progress on the walk, seeing more of the world,
        getting to the dog park.
    - It has been my dog's instinct to get excited at the prospect of going to
        the dog park. Now, that tendency to get excited has been reinforced. In
        her excited state, she has been rewarded for walking, for arriving at
        the dog park.
- A behaviour is "reinforced" by practice.
     - It was not my dog's instinct to come when called. But through successive
         rewardings of coming when called, she now will do so. Now, continuing
         practice reinforces that behaviour.
    - But she will no longer come when she senses a cuddle ambush! Now, every
        time I call her for cuddles, and she *refuses* to come, that refusal is
        also re-inforced.
    - In addition to being reinforced by reward, my dog also reinforces her
        pulling with practice. When I pull *her*, I reinforce it.
Dogs won't learn if they are overstimulated or overexcited. 
    attention .
- You can teach your dog how to choose to be calm as a default behaviour:
    - [Pretty helpful article that talks about "Settle"](http://yourdogsfriend.org/help/impulse-control/)
    - [Video by kikopup teaching Settle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wesm2OpE_2c)
    - [Teaching a dog to be calm *inside* when they were an *outside* dog](http://dogmantics.com/teaching-a-dog-previously-kept-outside-to-be-calm-inside-the-house/)
- If you want to teach your dog to *not* do something, be vigilant about giving
    them what they want when they are not doing it, and taking something away
    when they are. E.g.,
    - Leaving kitchen door open while dog not in kitchen; closing it as soon as
      dog sticks face in.
    - Feeding little treats while dog lies nicely down under the table while we
        are eating; putting all the treats away as soon as they get up.
    - Putting on collar as long as they are sitting still; remove collar, put
        it away, and go do something else as soon as they become lazy and lie
        down or as soon as their butt pops up.
    Sometimes they will *mostly* obey you but still try to get away with things
    if they feel the tradeoff is worth it. Crank up the removal of desired objects
    until they are being obedient as much as you need them to be.
- Eventually your dog will learn 'no'. Before that, it's really hard to teach
    them *not* to do something. How do they know they are being rewarded for
    *not* doing something? Learning 'No' is very helpful.
- Giving my dog a dog-bed has helped (I think) make her more relaxed.
    - It's her space, no one will bother her there, she can relax and chew her
        bones there.
    - You can tell her to go to her bed while you do otherwise disturbing chores
        such as vacuum, sweep, or move furniture around.
- Get a dog-walker.
    - A good dog-walker will train off-leash recall, no jumping, etc.
    - If you go for group-walks, your dog will become part of a pack. Deep bonds form
        between the dogs. They spend less time figuring out *how*
        to have fun with the other dogs, and more time just having fun.
    - Your dog will be rid of excess energy otherwise used to whine and bother
        you when you are at home, and chew important things when you are out. The
        dog feels more at ease to just sleep, because her basic needs are met.
- I have found that the age 9-10 months is when things get a lot easier.
    - My dog got a lot more focus at that time
    - was able to better understand cause and effect relationships,
    - and became overall more affectionate and loving.

    Before 9 months, training to do certain things was a nightmare, an
    exercise in despair and frustration. Concepts like these would fall on deaf ears:
    - don't go in the kitchen
    - don't race through doors ahead of me
    - don't pull me on walks", "don't chase that squirrel
    - sit (not lie down, not run around) while I put your collar on to go for a walk
- Success percentage for obedience in a given environment:
    - 80% <=: your dog is good :)
    - 60-80%: Keep training in that environment
    - < 60%: dial down the distraction, distance, or duration. Your dog will
        only learn to not-listen in this environment.
    - Easy way to check: choose 5 treats. Do exercise. When dog fails, set
        treat aside. When dog suceeds, give treat. If you have 0-1 treat set
        aside, great! if you have 2 treats set aside, keep practicing! If you have 3 or
        more set aside, lower your criteria for success, lower the
        distractions, something.
- A "fluent behaviour" is
    - one that is obeyed under the following variables: Distraction, Distance
        (from you), Duration (of the obedience, eg for stay, or loose leash walking).
        - You can inject distractions like this:
            - jumping, wagging your finger, spinning.
            - practice in different rooms, on different surfaces (tile, grass, bed...)
        - Remember, a click *ends* the behaviour. One way to increase duration
            is by counting an additional count each iteration. When the dog
            fails, start back at 1 (or 10% of your goal).
        - You can use this counting  method to also increase distance between
            you and the dog. Your dog will likely think that performing X means
            performing it in front of you, so they may come to you before performing. you
            may need to leverage baby gates or something to separate you from your dog.
    - one that is precise, executed right away, and executed quickly
    - one that is offered if and only if cued, and only it is offered, and it
        is offered quickly.
        - This may be desirable for some behaviours, but you should always
            enforce volunteering to sit for a guest, volunteering to go to the
            dog bed or crate, or making eye contact in a distracting location.
    - You can optimise for whatever of the above you want to.
    - Don't increase difficulty in more than 1 of the above at once.
    - The first couple "fluent" behaviours will be the hardest to achieve. The
        subsequent ones should be easier as your dog figures things out.
    - Good rule of thumb: 85% success in at least 20 places in your home is a
        good start to fluency
- When trying to get your dog from being distracted:
    - remember, many small distractions can really add up to distract your dog.
    - make the dog feel better about being in the presence of a distraction by
        consistently and repeatedly pairing the distraction with a particular
        reward.
    - some variables you can play with:
        - try playing (eg tug of warring) past distractions, some dogs respond
            more to that than food
        - increase rate of reward past distractions
        - increase value of reward past distractions
        - if your dog is goot at "following a target" (sticking his nose in
            your hand for a long period), try that past a distraction
        - increase your speed past a distraction. Run past it, then when they
            can handle the distraction, jog past it, walk past it, walk slowly
            past it.
        - decrease distance to distraction
- Stop, Watch, Wait, Reward. How to get your dog to not jump when you come into the house, eg.
    - When you come into the house and your dog is jumping all over you, remain perfectly still.
    - Watch for the behaviour you want - 4 paws on floor, eye contact, eg.
    - wait until your dog does that.
    - click and treat.
    - Do this every time you come home. Your dog will more quickly do the thing you want.
    - It helps to keep a clicker and treats near the door.
- When your dog is barking (crying?) for something (e.g. food, poo-break), the
    thing that they want is the ultimate reinforcer. Don't wait till their
    barking becomes unbearable before giving them the ultimate reward. Instead,
    after 1 bark/whine, maybe make them sit,
    click-reward them, when they finish eating click-reward again, and again, till they
    freely offer a couple moments of silence. Then give them their food.
    Alternately  anticipate what they want and do the sit-reward-silence routine as
    soon as they come to you.
* If your dog is really excited before leaving the house, wait till she is a
    bit less excited, click and open the door to let her out.

* The most important learning happens when the dog succeeds and is rewarded,
    not when he fails.
* [Train your dog to lie down peacfully beside the dinner table when
    eating](http://www.clickertraining.com/node/596)
* Train your dog to "Get It" as a way of distracting your dog from a great many
    things (e.g. passing dogs). "Get It" tells the dog they should start
    sniffing the ground for an unknown quantity of delicious treats of unknown
    nature, most likely behind you. Sniffing naturally relaxes the dog, which
    is then rewarded by finding the treats. You should train your dog to "Get
    It" while they are wearing whatever collar and leash they would be wearing
    outside. That way your dog will start sniffing, completely distracted,
    naturally relax, and you can block the destraction with your body.

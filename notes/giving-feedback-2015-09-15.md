# Feedback vs Coaching

- Feedback is not coaching.
- Feedback is reactive, Coaching is proactive.

When you're arguing with someone on the internet, you need to first decide if
they are arguing with good intentions.

Why do middle-managers always feel isolated and alone? Maybe they don't get a
lot of feedback!

When you have a feedback conversation with someone, you might want to follow
the following steps:

- prepare:
    - What situation are you addressing?
    - What outcome do you want? Want them to just know what's up? Want them to
        commit to changing?
    - Where are you at WRT the situation? Are you following into an
        interpretation trap? Most Respectful Interpretation
    - Anticipate the other's reaction. Spend some time in their shoes. Outline
        the conversation. (Side benefit: This will help you find facts rather
        than seeking an interpretation.)
- Open:
    - gauge mood
    - Open with your objective. Favour "There needs to be a change in..." over
        "your behaviour was unacceptable". "Bad kid!" doesn't really work, maybe
        ever.
    - Make it safe. Explain that you assume their good intentions

- Rinse, repeat:
    - Share your Feedback. Don't dilly dally. use STAR principle: Situation, task, action and result:
        - What is the situation. If you don't share a specific situation, it's
            erring on the side of nagging.
        - What were you all trying to do when X happened
        - What was the action they took
        - What was the result. Don't be too blamey
            Fall back on Observable behaviour, respectful interpretation.
    - Ask questions: open and closed.
    - Listen


Open questions help reveal truth, discuss, uncover ideas, their own solutions.
Closed questions give closure, getting people to agree to something specific.

Use closed questions as a tool, but sparingly - because they have more social
pressure around them. Good to use them at the end of a feedback conversation
after both parties have agreed what happened and what should happen.

If you are convinced the person does *not* have good intentions, still worth it
to have the conversation of "I feel like you don't want the team to succeed.
Prove me otherwise." If you couch every bad statement with a good statement,
people will learn not to trust you.

When you give "hey you did a good job on this, bye!", people stop trusting you

It's ok to end a listening "conversation" with no solution, with the problem
hanging in the air. Sometimes that's what people want. You can ask them, is
there anything I can do to help? But sometimes they know the problem can't be
solved.

- Success percentage for obedience in a given environment:
    - 80% <=: your dog is good :)
    - 60-80%: Keep training in that environment
    - < 60%: dial down the distraction, distance, or duration. Your dog will
        only learn to not-listen in this environment.
    - Easy way to check: choose 5 treats. Do exercise. When dog fails, set
        treat aside. When dog suceeds, give treat. If you have 0-1 treat set
        aside, great! if you have 2 treats set aside, keep practicing! If you have 3 or
        more set aside, lower your criteria for success, lower the
        distractions, something.
- A "fluent behaviour" is
    - one that is obeyed under the following variables: Distraction, Distance
        (from you), Duration (of the obedience, eg for stay, or loose leash walking).
        - You can inject distractions like this:
            - jumping, wagging your finger, spinning.
            - practice in different rooms, on different surfaces (tile, grass, bed...)
        - Remember, a click *ends* the behaviour. One way to increase duration
            is by counting an additional count each iteration. When the dog
            fails, start back at 1 (or 10% of your goal).
        - You can use this counting  method to also increase distance between
            you and the dog. Your dog will likely think that performing X means
            performing it in front of you, so they may come to you before performing. you
            may need to leverage baby gates or something to separate you from your dog.
    - one that is precise, executed right away, and executed quickly
    - one that is offered if and only if cued, and only it is offerred, and it
        is offered quickly.
        - This may be desirable for some behaviours, but you should always
            enforce volunteering to sit for a guest, volunteering to go to the
            dog bed or crate, or making eye contact in a distracting location.
    - You can optimise for whatever of the above you want to.
    - Don't increase difficulty in more than 1 of the above at once.
    - The first couple "fluent" behaviours will be the hardest to achieve. The
        subsequent ones should be easier as your dog figures things out.
- When trying to get your dog from being distracted:
    - remember, many small distractions can really add up to distract your dog.
    - make the dog feel better about being in the presence of a distraction by
        consistently and repeatedly pairing the distraction with a particular
        reward.
    - some variables you can play with:
        - try playing (eg tug of warring) past distractions, some dogs respond
            more to that than food
        - increase rate of reward past distractions
        - increase value of reward past distractions
        - if your dog is goot at "following a target" (sticking his nose in
            your hand for a long period), try that past a distraction
        - increase your speed past a distraction. Run past it, then when they
            can handle the distraction, jog past it, walk past it, walk slowly
            past it.
        - decrease distance to distraction
- Stop, Watch, Wait, Reward. How to get your dog to not jump when you come into the house, eg.
    - When you come into the house and your dog is jumping all over you, remain perfectly still.
    - Watch for the behaviour you want - 4 paws on floor, eye contact, eg.
    - wait until your dog does that.
    - click and treat.
    - Do this every time you come home. Your dog will more quickly do the thing you want.
    - It helps to keep a clicker and treats near the door.
- When your dog is barking (crying?) for something (e.g. food, poo-break), the
    thing that they want is the ultimate reinforcer. Don't wait till their
    barking becomes unbearable before giving them the ultimate reward. Instead,
    after 1 bark/whine, maybe make them sit,
    click-reward them, when they finish eating click-reward again, and again, till they
    freely offer a couple moments of silence. Then give them their food.
    Alternately  anticipate what they want and do the sit-reward-silence routine as
    soon as they come to you.
* If your dog is really excited before leaving the house, wait till she is a
    bit less excited, click and open the door to let her out.

* The most important learning happens when the dog succeeds and is rewarded,
    not when he fails.

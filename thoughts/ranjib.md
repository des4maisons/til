These ideas come from talking to @RanjibDey.

- The idea of "human schedulers", scheduling tasks for humans of varying
    skills, capacities, drive
- Relationships are the result of investment across 3 axes - time, money and emotion.
- The art of saying no is the crux of prioritization
- You can see how a company values the automation of a task by how much they
    pay people to "mamu-code", i.e. do repetitive tasks manually.
- Learn to grep from inside your editor. You do this all the time. The
    switching between windows to grep will, at the end of your career, have cost
    you maybe 6 months of time.
- Quick way to write a presentation:
    - Pre-req: you need a list of the topics you want to cover. This comes by
        mulling over it over time.
    - order these topics in a way that gives you the best story.
    - To make the presentation more generally applicable and less opinionated,
        talk about the things you could have done but didn't, the things you
        don't like, other perspectives
    - "this is my opinion, these are other opinions, these are the facts."
- Coding is not like coal mining. If you are interrupted while doing a critical
    thing, who knows how much time you will take to get back into it. This is one
    reason that estimates don't work too well.
- Lead from within. If you are a scrum master, you should do a bit of ux or
    something to contribute to the team, so that you can understand.
- 5 year, 10 year, 15 year plan - subtract all the things that you *don't* want
    to be doing, and what your left with are some pretty good things you can
    focus on. When you have a 5 year plan, even if it doesn't stay the same for
    the next 5 years, it will give you focus for tomorrow, for next week, for
    next month. It is valuable even if it doesn't turn out to be a *5* year
    plan.

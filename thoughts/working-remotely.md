* Eye-contact is hard! How do you have eye contact in a google hang out?
* Talking over beers is hard! I mean you could join a hangout, but then we come
    back to the fact that eye contact is hard!
* Need to make room for daily venting to your team. I want to know what my team
    members are fighting with! I want them to know what I am fighting! Maybe we
    can all give each other perspective (it's not so bad) or suggestions (have you
    tried this), instead of being alone with our problems
    * Can standup be the place for this? retros?

- Things whose data sources are simple yaml files or hash tables are nice.
    Things that make it hard to programmatically update their data sources are
    not nice :(
- When proposing a change, phrase the proposition as "Does anyone object to
    this?" vs "Is this OK?". There are a lot of ways to do things and you work
    with smart people who have lots of strong, well-informed opinions. Avoid
    triggering that in the wrong way.
- When someone is explaining something you asked about, don't get annoyed when
    they explain something you already know. You've already decided it's ok to
    not know something by asking in the first place. So you should not feel
    ashamed or offended when someone thinks there's something else you don't
    know.
- "Do the simplest thing that could possibly work." - Ward Cunningham
- When you build a command line tool to do something, it means it can be run
    from jenkins :)
- When some code you write interacts with private github repos, you need to
    take care that the extra step of authentication doesn't make it impossible
    to automate your processes.

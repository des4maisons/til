- When someone is explaining something you asked about, don't get annoyed when
    they explain something you already know. You've already decided it's ok to
    not know something by asking in the first place. So you should not feel
    ashamed or offended when someone thinks there's something else you don't
    know.

- When you build a command line tool to do something, it means it can be run
    from jenkins :)
